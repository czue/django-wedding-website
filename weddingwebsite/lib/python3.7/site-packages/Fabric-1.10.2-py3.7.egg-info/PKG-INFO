Description: 
        To find out what's new in this version of Fabric, please see `the changelog
        <http://fabfile.org/changelog.html>`_.
        
        You can also install the `in-development version
        <https://github.com/fabric/fabric/tarball/master#egg=fabric-dev>`_ using
        pip, with `pip install fabric==dev`.
        
        ----
        
        Fabric is a Python (2.5-2.7) library and command-line tool for
        streamlining the use of SSH for application deployment or systems
        administration tasks.
        
        It provides a basic suite of operations for executing local or remote shell
        commands (normally or via ``sudo``) and uploading/downloading files, as well as
        auxiliary functionality such as prompting the running user for input, or
        aborting execution.
         
        Typical use involves creating a Python module containing one or more functions,
        then executing them via the ``fab`` command-line tool. Below is a small but
        complete "fabfile" containing a single task:
        
        .. code-block:: python
        
            from fabric.api import run
        
            def host_type():
                run('uname -s')
        
        Once a task is defined, it may be run on one or more servers, like so::
        
            $ fab -H localhost,linuxbox host_type
            [localhost] run: uname -s
            [localhost] out: Darwin
            [linuxbox] run: uname -s
            [linuxbox] out: Linux
        
            Done.
            Disconnecting from localhost... done.
            Disconnecting from linuxbox... done.
        
        In addition to use via the ``fab`` tool, Fabric's components may be imported
        into other Python code, providing a Pythonic interface to the SSH protocol
        suite at a higher level than that provided by e.g. the ``Paramiko`` library
        (which Fabric itself uses.)
