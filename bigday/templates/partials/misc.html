                Organic food means no persistent pesticides or synthetic fertilizers, which might have dangerous consequences on human health;
                no GMOs with unknown consequences for us and for our ecosystem;
                and better treatment of animals, including no synthetic growth or breeding hormones.
                It is a cause that Cory’s parents are extremely passionate about and something we were excited to bring to our wedding.
